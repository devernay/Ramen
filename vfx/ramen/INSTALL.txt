1. Dependencies

You need the following libraries to build ramen:

Name			Website				    Versions tested
----			-------				    ---------------

OpenGL			included in your system		    2.0 or newer
Boost			www.boost.org			    1.42 or 1.43 ( other versions don't work)
Intel TBB		www.threadingbuildingblocks.org	    2.2 (3.0 is untested)
QT			www.qtsoftware.com		    4.4.3 or newer
IlmBase			www.openexr.net			    1.0.1
OpenEXR			www.openexr.net			    1.6.0
Libjpeg
Libtiff
Libpng
python			www.python.org			    2.6
OpenImageIO						    SVN Release branch 0.8 or later
cortex-vfx		code.google.com/p/cortex-vfx/       5.0.0 (Headers only, no need to build the libraries)

2. Compiling

Get and install the dependencies using their respective instructions.
You need to build boost and TBB first.

Building boost as shared libraries is recommended.
Add threading=multi variant=release link=shared to the bjam command.

Get CMake if not already installed in your system.

You need a SVN client to download OpenImageIO. There's no public
release yet.

build the other dependencies

download cortex-vfx and copy the include/IECore dir where 
your compiler can find it (/usr/local/include is a good choice in unix systems)

Then do:

cd <ramen directory>
edit CMakeLists.txt as needed
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
make
