This plugin is under the GPL license, as the original Blender code it's based in.

It's not clear if you are allowed to use this plugin in a non GPL compatible host 
application, like Ramen, Nuke or the other commercial apps that use OFX plugins.

For more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html, 
in particular http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPluginsInNF 
and http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NFUseGPLPlugins

My opinion is that this is the borderline case described in 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#NFUseGPLPlugins.

I think the code is also useful as an example how to write a basic OFX plugin 
and some open source GPL compatible projects are starting to support the OFX standard, 
like TuttleOFX (a command line tool to process images).
