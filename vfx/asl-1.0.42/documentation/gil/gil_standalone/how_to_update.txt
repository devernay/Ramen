Steps to follow to update the GIL stand-alone web pages:
The paths below refer to subdirectories inside "submission/adobe/"

1. Make sure the GIL header files at adobe/gil/... contain external files only. Delete any internal files. For example in the io extension files like image_io.hpp, targa.hpp, io_factory.hpp, and *_old.hpp are not yet part of the stand-alone version of GIL

2. If the tutorial or the design guide changed, you will need to regenerate their PDF versions: 
 Run the doxygen script at documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil_pdf_documentation.doxygen. (This generates the files in a style good for PDF)
 Open the file documentation/gil/gil_standalone/html/gildesignguide.html and save to PDF at documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil/gil_design_guide.pdf
 Open the file documentation/gil/gil_standalone/html/giltutorial.html and save to PDF at documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil/gil_tutorial.pdf

3. Delete the folder documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil/html (if it exists)

4. Run the doxygen script at documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil_standalone.doxygen. This should regenerate the html folder above

5. Compress the GIL header files at adobe/adobe/gil/... into documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil/gil.zip and documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil/gil.tar.gz
Also compress _separately_ the numeric extension
tar zcf gil.tar.gz gil

6. The folder documentation/gil/gil_standalone/gil now contains the proper web page.

7. Update the documentation sample files

8. Open a connection with webprod.macromedia.com:/data/www/sites/opensource-staging.adobe.com/htdocs/gil/ and FTP any changes to there.

9. Log in to http://webpush.macromedia.com/stlab.adobe.com

10. Push all changed files (may need to check the "push all subdirectories of selected items"). The website should update.
